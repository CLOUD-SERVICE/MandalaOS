The Mandala OS

"Mandala OS is the name for an ad hoc collaborative creative conversation committee spontaneously formed around the discussion, contemplation and experimentation of this paradigm as a platform for governing the meaning of what it is to be a Human Being specifically, and what it means - more universally - to be a thinking, feeling, perceiving sentient being.

The main focus on human computer interface, I think, should be on the power of ritual as a method of interacting with both the visible and invisible worlds. This is a major factor of why I’ve become so interested in a sort of intuitive urban revival of shamanic practices: little rituals I carry out in my room using magic rocks, burning leaves, and whatever other types of objects I can press into service to achieve my creative ends.

I see absolutely no reason why we can’t have a massively popular technology which teaches people to solve problems creatively, how to access the wonders of their intuition and subconscious, and how to tap into Fundamental Universal Laws & Patterns Known to the Ancients™

The Mandala OS is the ideal breeding ground for the post-computer post-scarcity shaman, the roving troubadour, the bard, the actor, the comedian, the tragedian. It should reward you for goofing off, and encourage exactly the types of behaviors we need so badly to see to instantiate a Global Renaissance!"
